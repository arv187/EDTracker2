>EDTracker2 sketches for Arduino IDE. These are subdivided by various hardware
>types; make sure you choose the sketch appropriate for the hardware you're using
>(motion sensor, for example). Place these in your Arduino IDE sketches folder
>(typically in "My Documents/Arduino").
>
>NOTE: To make the build process easier, all the libraries and relevant hardware
>settings are packaged up and available within the separate repo here :
>
>https://github.com/brumster/EDTracker2_ArduinoHardware
>
>You WILL need the additional libraries and modified Arduino core files provided in the
>above repo; the sketches will not compile without them :)
>
>EDTracker 2 sketches are currently as follows :
>
>- EDTracker2_6050 - for use with Invensense MPU-6050 breakout boards (accel/gyro only)
>- EDTracker2_9150 - for use with Invensense MPU-9150 breakout boards (accel/gyro/magnetometer)
>- EDTracker2_9250 - for use with Invensense MPU-9250 breakout boards (accel/gyro/magnetometer)
>
>Once built, you will need the EDTracker GUI software to calibrate and monitor
>
>Tested/verified with Arduino IDE 1.8.5
>
>Love and manly hugs!
